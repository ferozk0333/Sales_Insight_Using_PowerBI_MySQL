# Data Visualization Using Power BI Dashboard  

## Overview  
This project focuses on creating a Power BI dashboard to address sales insights challenges faced by a hardware company. The dashboard provides real-time, data-driven insights for stakeholders, enabling effective decision-making and reducing reliance on manual reporting.

## Problem Statement  
The Sales Director relied on verbal updates and large Excel files, which led to inconsistent reporting and difficulty tracking real-time sales performance. A centralized, interactive dashboard was required to visualize sales trends and empower data-driven decision-making.
