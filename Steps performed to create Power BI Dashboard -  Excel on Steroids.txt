Data Exploration and Cleaning: (Summary)

Issues Identified:
	Invalid entries in the markets table (non-Indian entries removed).
	Garbage values in the transactions table (sales amounts ≤ 0 filtered).
	Currency inconsistencies ("INR\r" and "USD\r" corrected).
	Duplicates removed.

Actions:
	Performed data cleaning in MySQL Workbench and Power Query to ensure a high-quality dataset for dashboard creation.

ETL Process:

	Connected MySQL database to Power BI.
	Transformed data in Power Query by filtering invalid rows, normalizing currency values, and retaining only relevant data.
	Constructed a data pipeline:
	Source Data (MySQL) → Navigation (Raw Data) → Filtered Rows → Added Conditional Columns

Dashboard Development:

	Visual Components:
		Slicers for dynamic filtering.
	Horizontal stacked charts for regional comparisons.
	Cards for KPIs like total revenue and YoY growth.
	Line charts for trend analysis over time.
	Insights Delivered:
		Revenue breakdown by region, product category, and time.
		Identification of sales trends and anomalies.
		Data-driven recommendations for business growth.




1. Exploring dataset: (In-depth including rough work)

Basic analysis using MySQL Workbench.
---Markets table - Two entries with zone as ''. These market names are outside India though.
Maybe there was one time buiness with these places and hence they are there. But our problem statement
states that the company's business focus is only in India and the stakeholders have asked to not consider abroad entries. 

---Products table:

191	Own Brand
88	Distribution

---Transactions Table:
Over 150K records in the transaction table.
Sales_amount <= 0 in many rows. Doesn't make sense. Garbage values.
There are two currency types: INR and USD.

Duplicate records -- select distinct(currency) from transactions;
 'INR'
'INR\r'

select count(*) from transactions where currency = 'INR\r'; --> 150000
select count(*) from transactions where currency = 'INR'; --> 279
select count(*) from transactions where currency = 'USD'; -->2
select count(*) from transactions where currency = 'USD\r'; -->2

select * from transactions where currency = 'USD' or currency = 'USD\r'; --> Indeed duplicate


---Customer table contains all the clients(38) of the Company. Brick & Mortar OR E-Commerce platform. 

2. Data Cleaning and ETL
	Pull Data in Power BI  -  Connect localhost, preview database and load first
	ETL using Power Query - Choose table -> Home -> Transform data
		Apply filter to markets table for non-blank
		Apply filter to uncheck <=0 sales_amount in transactions table
		Convert USD to INR -> Add Column -> Conditional -> New column 'Normalized_currency' 
		Apply filter to select only INR and USD (remove duplicates)
		Home -> Close and Apply

	
Data Pipeline: Source Data (MySQL) -> Navigation (Raw data) -> Filtered rows -> Added Conditional column

3. Building Dashboard
	Slicer
	Horizonal Stacked charts
	Cards
	Line Chart
